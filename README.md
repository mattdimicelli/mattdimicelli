I’m a self-taught Front-End Web Developer with a strong work ethic and a lifelong passion for learning and technology. I coupled the open-source Odin Project web development curriculum with some techniques that I previously used to master the Spanish language when learning to code from February 2021 to the present. Although I’m now experienced in modern React, I made sure to put a major emphasis on learning the basics, which include a strong foundation in the three core web languages. I continue to work every day to refine my front-end skills and am also becoming proficient in working with Node.js, with the goal of enhancing my knowledge of the full stack to the point where I’m fluent in back-end development. Before studying web development, I was an experienced Registered Nurse holding several advanced certifications in my professional specialty.
