Matthew Di Micelli is a self-taught Frontend Web Developer with a strong work ethic and a lifelong passion for learning and technology.
He used the open-source Odin Project curriculum to guide his learning from February 2021 to the present. Although Matthew is now 
experienced in modern React, he made sure to emphasize learning the basics, which include a strong foundation in the three core web 
languages: JS, HTML, and CSS. He is including older projects that were built without any frameworks in his portfolio to demonstrate 
that he can do so. Matthew continues to work every day to refine his skills and is also becoming proficient in working with Node.JS, 
with the goal of enhancing his knowledge of the full stack to the point where he is fluent in backend development. Before initiating 
his web development studies, he worked as a Registered Nurse and held advanced certifications in his area.
