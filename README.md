I’m a self-taught Full Stack Web Developer with a strong work ethic and a lifelong passion for learning and technology.  I coupled the open-source Odin Project web development curriculum with techniques that I previously used to master the Spanish language when learning to code from February 2021 to the present. Although 
I’m now experienced with the MERN stack, I made sure to put a major emphasis on learning the basics first, which include a strong foundation in the three core web 
languages.  I continue to work every day to refine my skills. Before studying web development, I was an experienced Registered Nurse holding several advanced certifications in my professional specialty.
