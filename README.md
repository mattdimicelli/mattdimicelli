I’m a self-taught **Full Stack Web Developer**!  I coupled the open-source Odin Project web development curriculum with techniques that I previously used to master the Spanish language when learning to code from February 2021 to the present.  Although I’m now experienced with the MERN stack, I made sure to put a major emphasis on learning the basics first, which include a strong foundation in the three core web languages.  I continue to work every 
day to refine my skills.

Before studying web development, I was an experienced Registered Nurse holding several advanced certifications in my professional specialty.
